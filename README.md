# Token Router

A simple app to transfer any ERC tokens with the integration of MetaMask. Currently supports STK tokens, but you can easily transfer any token by making a small change in the code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- A MetaMask wallet with some STK tokens.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

```
https://github.com/hrsh22/token-router.git
```
 
2. Navigate to the project directory

```
cd token-router
```

3. Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Running the App
Start the development server with the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
### Changing the Token

To change the token you want to transfer, you need to change the contract address and Contract ABI located in the `Details.js` file inside the `components` folder.

### Raising Issues

If you require STK tokens for testing purposes, you can raise an issue in the repository and I will send some tokens to you for the trial.
